Comprehensive Project Summary Document

Project Name:

AI-Powered Search Platform

Objective:

Develop a modular, lightweight, and scalable search platform combining Elasticsearch for structured data querying and txtai for semantic, AI-enhanced insights. The proof of concept (PoC) will focus on creating a local application with basic search capabilities and a user-friendly interface.

Key Components and Roles

1. Elasticsearch
	•	Purpose: Structured data storage and querying.
	•	Role: Handles full-text search, filtering, and aggregations for indexed data.
	•	Features:
	•	Persistent, scalable storage for structured data.
	•	Advanced search and analytics capabilities.

2. txtai
	•	Purpose: AI-enhanced semantic search.
	•	Role: Processes and retrieves data based on embeddings for similarity and contextual understanding.
	•	Features:
	•	Lightweight, uses SQLite by default for local storage.
	•	Supports embeddings for advanced semantic queries.

3. Streamlit
	•	Purpose: Front-end user interface.
	•	Role: Provides a web-based, interactive search tool to query Elasticsearch and txtai.
	•	Features:
	•	Easy to implement and modify for prototyping.
	•	Accessible via browser for local testing.

4. Docker Compose
	•	Purpose: Orchestrates services for consistency and portability.
	•	Role: Simplifies deployment of Elasticsearch and txtai as containers.
	•	Features:
	•	Easy setup and teardown.
	•	Resource isolation for services.

Deliverables
	1.	Functional Local Application:
	•	Elasticsearch and txtai services running locally via Docker Compose.
	•	A Streamlit app providing a unified search interface for querying both systems.
	2.	Test Data Integration:
	•	Indexed test data in Elasticsearch and txtai.
	•	Example queries to validate system functionality.
	3.	Validation Workflow:
	•	Fully tested application with logs for Elasticsearch and txtai.
	•	Proof of concept demonstrating the integration of structured and semantic search capabilities.

Workflow

Phase 1: Setup
	1.	Install required tools (Docker, Python, Streamlit).
	2.	Create project structure with directories for data, configurations, and logs.

Phase 2: Service Configuration
	1.	Configure Elasticsearch with minimal settings for local use.
	2.	Use txtai’s default SQLite-based storage for simplicity.

Phase 3: Deployment
	1.	Deploy Elasticsearch and txtai using Docker Compose.
	2.	Validate that both services are running.

Phase 4: Data Ingestion
	1.	Index test data into Elasticsearch.
	2.	Add corresponding embeddings to txtai.

Phase 5: User Interface
	1.	Create a Streamlit app to query both Elasticsearch and txtai.
	2.	Display results side-by-side in the app for comparison.

Phase 6: Validation
	1.	Test queries to ensure correct functionality from both systems.
	2.	Monitor logs to identify and resolve any errors.

Phase 7: Cleanup (Optional)
	•	Stop and remove containers when not in use.

Hardware Requirements
	•	Local Setup:
	•	4GB RAM
	•	20GB free disk space
	•	Modern Linux, macOS, or Windows system
	•	For Future Scalability:
	•	Cloud-based deployment using managed Elasticsearch (e.g., AWS, GCP) and scalable txtai services.

Monetization and Scaling (Post-PoC)
	•	Basic Tier: Local version with default txtai and lightweight Elasticsearch setup.
	•	Premium Tier: Add advanced Elasticsearch features, integrations, and enterprise-grade analytics.

Next Steps
	1.	Complete local deployment and validation.
	2.	Document system setup, APIs, and usage.
	3.	Gather feedback on PoC to refine features.
	4.	Plan cloud/server-based scaling and enterprise integrations.
